Technical Skills Survey Project Part 2: Exercise 1 - The Story of Caesar's Traditional Secret Party
The Story of Caesar's Traditional Secret Party
In the heart of ancient Rome 🏛️, Julius Caesar had a secret 🤫. Not just about gladiators 🗡️ or gold 💰, but about... a party 🍾! This year, he would host a secret party only for his closest friends. This party was the talk of the town 🙊! There were magical fairies ✨, dancing peacocks 🦚, melodious harps 🎵, and sparkling fountains ⛲.
However, there was a problem 😲! Uninvited guests 🥷 would crash the party because the location 🗺️ would get leaked by spies 🕵️‍♂️.
Caesar needed a plan 💡! He thought, "I'll send out the invites encrypted 🔐. That way, only my true friends 🤝 will know when and where the party is!".
So, he came up with a cunning plan 🦊. Instead of writing the party location of the invitation directly 🏞️, he would shift each letter in by a fixed number 🔢. So, for example, if he decided to shift by 3:
•	A would become D 🔄
•	B would become E 🔄
•	C would become F 🔄
•	... and so on.
If the invite said "GARDEN" 🌳, he would write "JDUGHQ" 🤯.
When Brutus (Caesar's friend turned enemy) received the letter 📜, he knew about this secret code 🗝️. He would shift the letters back by the same number and decode "JDUGHQ" to "GARDEN" 🌳. Mmm, clever 🧠!
However, any nosy Romans 👀 intercepting the message would be baffled 😶‍🌫️! "JDUGHQ? What kind of place is that?" they would wonder 🤷‍♂️.
Thanks to the "Caesar Cipher" 🔐, Caesar's secret party remained exclusive 😼, magical 🌌, and crasher-free 🥳!
And while history 📖 might tell you that Brutus wasn't the most trustworthy of friends, at least in our story, he kept the party's secret 🎉 and never gave away the magical location 🌳! 😉🤫
