let partyLocation = ‘GARDEN’; //string
let cypherVariable = 3; //number
let codedPartyDetails = ""; //string
let decodedPartyDetails = ""; //string
let attendeeConfirmation = TRUE; //boolean

let codedPartyDetails = ""; //string
let decodedPartyDetails = ""; //string
let attendeeConfirmation = TRUE; //boolean

Number.isInteger(cypherVariable);
